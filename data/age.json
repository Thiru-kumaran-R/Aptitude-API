        "question": "A mother is twice as old as her son. After 6 years, her age will be three times the age of her son. What are their present ages?",
        "answer": "24 years, 12 years",
        "options": ["20 years, 10 years", "24 years, 12 years", "28 years, 14 years", "32 years, 16 years"],
        "explanation": "Let the present age of the son be x years. Then, the present age of the mother = 2x years. According to the given conditions, 2x + 6 = 3 * (x + 6). Solving this equation gives x = 6. Therefore, the present ages of the mother and the son are 24 years and 12 years respectively."
