According to alligation, the ratio of milk to water is (20 - 25) : (25 - 0) = 5 : 25 = 1 : 5. So, 1 part of milk is equivalent to 5 parts of water in the new mixture. Since the amount of milk remains the same, the amount of water should be 5 times the amount of milk. Hence, 6 + 5x = 25% of the new mixture, which implies x = 4 liters."
